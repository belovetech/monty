# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Monty
    A project for Alx Africa, this is an interpreter for Monty bytecodes files.
    Monty is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes.
    It relies on a unique stack data structure with specific instructions to manipulate it.
    Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension.
## push
    Usage: push <int> where <int> is an integer

    What it does: pushes an element to the stack.

## pall
    Usage: pall

    What it does: prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

## pint
    Usage: pint

    What it does: prints the value at the top of the stack followed by a new line.

## pop
    Usage: pop

    What it does: removes the top element of the stack.

## swap
    Usage: swap

    What it does: swaps the top two elements of the stack.

## add
    Usage: add

    What it does: adds the top two elements of the stack. The answer is stored in the second top
    element of the stack and the top element is removed so that the top element contains the result
    and the stack is one element shorter.

## sub
    Usage: sub

    What it does: subtracts the top element of the stack from the second element of the stack.
    The answer is stored in the second top element of the stack and the top element is removed
    so that the top element contains the result and the stack is one element shorter.

## div
    Usage: div

    What it does: divides the second top element of the stack by the first element of the stack.
    The answer is stored in the second top element of the stack and the top element is removed so
    that the top element contains the result and the stack is one element shorter.

## mul
    Usage: mul

    What it does: multiplies the top two elements of the stack.
    The answer is stored in the second top element of the stack
    and the top element is removed so that the top element contains the result and the stack is one element shorter.

## mod
    Usage: mod

    What it does: computes the remainder of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
    The answer is stored in the second top element of the stack and the top element is removed so that the top element contains
    the result and the stack is one element shorter.
